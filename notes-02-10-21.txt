Notes from Zoom Meeting:


Currently we have:
- Popular movies count by platform
- Percent of movies by age rating by platform
- Percent of movies by genre by platform
- IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes scores vs. ages vs. platform
- Heatmap of popular movies across platforms


General Comments:
- Create more of a side by side comparison for some of the plots
- Some of the plots enlarge the font
- Might want to consider changing the scatter plots into multi-bar plots
- Add TV shows? Do we want to do same plots?
- Other features: run time (length of movie), year made, country
    - TV shows and movies might have different features
- Recommender system for platform to use
    - Can return multiple recommendations based off of different metrics? (eg. quantity vs quality)


Other analyses:
- Dimensionality reduction on genres --> make this one scalar axis?
    - Sample some of the extremes and see what these are to get a feel for the latent variable
    - See where the platforms' distributions of movies fall on this scale


"*MovieGenres.png" :
- Can stagger the smaller categories so that the text doesn't look overlapped


"PopularMoviesHeatmap.png":
- Some movies that are on here aren't on any of the platforms -- do we still want to include?
- Maybe be more organized along y-axis in terms of groupings of movies?


To-do:
    Shivani:
        Similar plots, other features
    Jake:
        Dimensionality reduction
    Jinyu:
        Recommender System
    Laura:
        TV Shows
    Katrina:
        Edits to current plots (font bigger, fix overlapping font, scatter -> multi-line bar)
        Putting side by side

Next meeting:

    Monday Feb 22 8pm: Test Cases + Project Updates
