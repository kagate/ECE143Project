ECE 143 Team Meeting Feb 22
---------------------------

To-do From Last Time:
    Shivani:
        Similar plots, other features
    Jake:
        Dimensionality reduction
    Jinyu:
        Recommender System
    Laura:
        TV Shows
    Katrina:
        Edits to current plots (font bigger, fix overlapping font, scatter -> multi-line bar)
        Putting side by side


Laura:
	Re-did katrina's plots for the Tv shows

Shivani:
	Plotted for all the other features in the movie data set (languages, etc.)
	Still need to make them a little prettier (maybe going to use plotly or seaborn)

Jake:
	Didn't get super useful results from the PCA
	MCA package was a little buggy
	Could consider baking more features into the original space

Jinyu: 
	taking another approach
	dataset that records a lot of user about what kinds of film they have watched
	building recommender system on top of this data, trying to see which platform contains the recommended movies using this data
	Radar plot, also explains why PCA doesn't work well in 1 dimension

Katrina:
	fixed some of the plots that she had last time


What do we have to turn in? (March 12th)
-> at least some python code (link to github repo)
	-> consolidate into a Jupyter Notebook
-> presentation


Questions/Comments:
- What are going to be our final plots?
- What story are we going to tell?
- Look at parameters across platforms so that we can compare them side by side
- Base plots off of how recommendation system is going to work
- Let's have work done by 5th / 6th, then we have week to get the presentation done


Action Items For Next Time:

Jinyu
	Going to start coding recommender system
		user based and feature based
	Will send update when he has more information

Laura, Katrina, Shivani
	Meet for plots


Jake
	Get final jupyter notebook together
	Get final slides started
	Create skeleton of presentation story


When to meet next:
March 5th, 8pm
